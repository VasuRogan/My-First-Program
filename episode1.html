	it started with setting up the environment which included downloading of the softwares.
	the names were new to me.<br>
	for the reason i started learning computer language again after 20 frigging years!<br>
	none of the scripts and appearances on the screen made sense to me<br>
	Pontu set it up fo rme and i was just wondering how typing a single digit can result in entire page in a second!<br>
